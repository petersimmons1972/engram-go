## Key Lessons

Homelab:
- (4x) Backup before modifying critical files - design phase IS implementation for docs
- (2x) MCP config lives in ~/.claude.json - use `claude mcp add`, never create mcp_servers.json
- (2x) Validate what the customer sees, not intermediate formats
- (1x) RWO PVCs need Recreate deployment strategy, not RollingUpdate
- (1x) Chainguard images need fsGroup for PVC write access (non-root UID 65532)
- (1x) cert-manager pods use 10.42.x.x overlay network, not 192.168.x.x - breaks Cloudflare IP filtering
- (1x) WordPress behind reverse proxy needs WP_HOME/WP_SITEURL/FORCE_SSL_ADMIN in wp-config.php
- (1x) CronJob not Deployment for periodic tasks - liveness probes kill sleep loops (exit 137, low memory = not OOM)
- (1x) Homepage issues are almost always network policy label mismatch
- (1x) Local DNS CNAME records break cert-manager DNS-01 challenges - use dnsPolicy: None + Cloudflare DNS

General:
- (1x) Every plan needs explicit validation checklist, not just "verify it works"
- (1x) Cloudflare negative DNS cache lasts 1800s - CDN purge won't help, wait or use different record name
- (1x) When Cloudflare zone records don't resolve, check TLD NS delegation before debugging the zone
- (2x) BeautifulSoup destroys SVG xmlns attributes (all parsers) - extract SVG first, process HTML, restore SVG after
- (1x) Duplicate Python method definitions: last definition wins, silently overwrites earlier ones
- (1x) When generated content disappears, trace through ALL post-processing steps - intermediate success ≠ final success
- (1x) Regex HTML manipulation is fragile - corrupts tags, creates malformed HTML - use BeautifulSoup with SVG extraction instead
- (1x) TDD with failing test first prevents spec drift - confirms you're testing the right thing before implementation
- (1x) Two-stage review (spec compliance first, code quality second) catches both functional and implementation issues
- (1x) Fresh subagent per task prevents context pollution - clean slate for each independent unit of work
- (1x) URL validation: mimic Windows 11 + Chrome (current stable) user-agent to avoid 403 from legitimate sites - update monthly

## How This System Works

When a lesson is learned:
1. Write detail to the relevant topic file in memory/
2. Add or increment counter in "Key Lessons" above
3. If it's a behavioral NEVER/ALWAYS rule, add to CLAUDE.md Critical Rules
